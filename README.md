- Designing intuitive user interfaces for exploring spatial and categorical data.

Areas for Improvement
- Add additional layers (e.g., street infrastructure, traffic camera data).
- Improve loading speed, as over 2 billion records are beign read in
- Enable exporting filtered data as CSV for user analysis.
- Incorporate time-based animation to visualize violation trends over years.
